        <p>
            shuttle runs are condcuted to test the edurance and stamina of the player.Basicaly the player has to run between 3 cones 
            the players have to sprint fast to complete one set. Each player has to complete 4 sets with and without ball.the shuttle 
            runs with balls are coducted to test the dribbling and ball control of the players.

            <u>short and long passing</u>

        </h2>
        <p>
            short and long passing evaluates touches and is one of the most important aspect of playing a football match.
            we can juge a player by thier passing skills.
            A long pass is generally more attacking than a short pass, but this can depend on where the player is located on the field.
             If the player wants to drive his pass, 
            he should approach the ball at a 30-degree angle so there is room to swing his kicking leg through.
        </p>

    <h2 style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;font: Arial Narrow Bold;">
        <u>long balls</u></h2>
        <p>
            a long ball is an attempt to move the ball a long distance down the field via one long aerial kick from either a goalkeeper or a defender directly to an attacking player, with the ball generally bypassing the midfield. 
            ... In Continental Europe the style is called kick and rush. it evaluates wether the player can kick long balls and also checks the touch of the player
            recieving the ball

            <u>3 vs 2</u></h2>
            <p>
                This drill is designed to focus on all aspects of the game in a 3v2 situation. Mainly runs of attackers, angle of support, passing vs.
                 shooting decisions, defensive shape, and recovery runs, along with working on mental attentiveness

            <p>
                Coaching these soccer shooting drills will enhance your players’ ability to beat the goalkeeper from many different positions.
                Shooting is a core soccer skill for EVERY player and we have some great ways to coach it.
                We look at shooting from dead ball situations, shooting while running, shooting first time, drive shots and how to make the ball bend, curl and dip.
                We have great soccer shooting drills and games to help you coach the skills to all your players.

            <u>possesion game</u></h2>
            <p>
                Possession in soccer is the ability to move the ball around the pitch in efforts to unbalance the opponent and advance the ball.
                However, possession is more than just keeping the ball away from the opponent by kicking the ball around the field.
                Possession is about movement, vision, teamwork, chemistry, creativity, and can often keep your team from fatiguing before their opponent.

            <u>MATCH</u></h1>
            <p>
                The two most immediate differences are the individual ball's purpose – one is used for training sessions while the other is used for matches – and their price.
                It's clear that match balls cost substantially more than training balls do which is decidedly due to the increased quality.
                Although a soccer player's day is broken up into several stages, there are 2 main training sessions per day – morning and afternoon.
                Including game days, players will normally train 5 to 6 days per week. Teams rarely train heavily on travel days.
                
               
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="muj1">
        <h2 style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;font: Arial Narrow Bold;">
            <u>MULTIPLE ROUNDS</u></h2>
            <p>
               multiple round are conducted to select the best lot of players for the team and players not selected can perform in intra-college 
               tournaments (league,inter-branch,futsal ETC.) and get selected for the main team 
               
            </p>

    <h1 id="C2"style="text-align:centre;font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif ;font: Arial Narrow bold;">
        <u>TRAINING</u>
    </h1>
    <p>
        3 days a week drills are conducted to increase endurance,stamina and footwork. circuit drills for endurance is conducted 
        on alternate drill day and drills like shooting and 3vs2 are conducted in other drill day left.The average professional player now covers over 10km in a 90-minute match.
        These days it’s not just about increasing lung capacity – the demands of the game have increased so exponentially that being bigger, more powerful and explosive is more critical than ever.
        At the start of every drill day warm up session is done to ensure ur body is completly warmed up.A 15 min jogging is conducted and after every round the pace of jogging
        increases
        <br>
        after jogging stretching is done to prevent injuries.injuries are prevented by proper warm up and stretching.After the complete warm up session competative shuttle runs are conducted
        . Each player has to complete 3 sets.after all the warm and shuttle session the further warm will be either with ball or endurance depending on the day.Each player has the right to share thier
        idea of variety of drill so they can discuss with the team captain and seniors.the more isea the better the drill day.
        <br>
        </p>
        <h2><u>With ball</u></h2>
        <p> training with ball increases your touches, shooting and passing skills which are the basic skills required for a team to play a better game
            different drills are discussed and decided before entering the ground so there is less wastage of time and more time is utilised on the field for a productive outcome

        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>without ball</u></h2>
        <p>
            training without ball increases you endurance, stamina and speed and icreases your overall fitness which helps in increasing the pace of the game and also increases the capacity of a player
            to complete a match during tournaments.
            Again all the drills are already decided.after every drill day a possesion game is conducted
        </p>
        <h2><u>match day</u></h2>
        <p>
            the match day is condcuted every alternate day.Only the players who were present in the previous drill day are allowed in the match day.two captains are decided and the choose players 
            and the rest of the players can be substituted after some time and 2 players are selected from the subs to check offside
            after the match captain gives an overall review about the match and asks opinion from the team
